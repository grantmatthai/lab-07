```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here is a simple chunk of code: 

```{r}
names <- c("John", "Emily", "Michael", "Sophia", "William", "Olivia", "James", "Emma", "Benjamin", "Ava")

ages <- c(32, 28, 35, 30, 40, 50, 39, 33, 37, 29)

careers <- c("Engineer", "Teacher", "Doctor", "Artist", "Accountant", 
               "Professor", "Nurse", "Writer", "Lawyer", "Chef")

df <- data.frame("Names" = names, "Age" = ages, "Career" = careers)
df
```
